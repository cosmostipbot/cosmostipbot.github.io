              <h2>Automatic collection of information</h2>
              <p>
                Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we
                exercise the no logs policy. We may process only minimal user
                data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the
                Website or Services. Information collected automatically is used
                only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish
                statistical information regarding Website usage. This
                statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a
                way that would identify any particular user of the system.
              </p>
              <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
              <p>
                You can visit the Website without telling us who you are or
                revealing any information by which someone could identify you as
                a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to
                use some of the Website's features, you may be asked to provide
                certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail
                address). We receive and store any information you knowingly
                provide to us when you create an account, make a purchase, or
                fill any online forms on the Website. When required, this
                information may include account details such as user name,
                unique user ID, password, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information,
                but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the
                Website's features. Users who are uncertain about what
                information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.

              <h2>Managing personal information</h2>
              <p>
                You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have
                about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as
                the Website or Services change. When you delete Personal
                Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised
                Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary
                to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners,
                and for the purposes described below.
              </p>
              <h2>Storing personal information</h2>
              <p>
                We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period
                necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
                disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention
                period is required or permitted by law. We may use any
                aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal
                Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner
                that would identify you personally. Once the retention period
                expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the
                right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
                rectification and the right to data portability cannot be
                enforced after the expiration of the retention period.

                In order to make our Website and Services available to you, or
                to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect and use certain
                Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that
                we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested
                products or services. Some of the information we collect is
                directly from you via our Website. However, we may also collect
                Personal Information about you from other sources such as social
                media, emails, etc. Any of the information we collect from you
                may be used for the following purposes:

                Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact
                with our Website, where you are located in the world and if one
                of the following applies: (i) You have given your consent for
                one or more specific purposes. This, however, does not apply,
                whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to
                California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law;
                (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance
                of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual
                obligations thereof; (iii) Processing is necessary for
                compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject;
                (iv) Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
                public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested
                in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the
                legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.

                without having to rely on consent or any other of the following
                legal bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the
                specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in
                particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a
                statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary
                to enter into a contract.

              <h2>Information transfer and storage</h2>
              <p>
                Depending on your location, data transfers may involve
                transferring and storing your information in a country other
                than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis
                of information transfers to a country outside the European Union
                or to any international organization governed by public
                international law or set up by two or more countries, such as
                the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard
                your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find
                out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or

              <h2>The rights of users</h2>
              <p>
                You may exercise certain rights regarding your information
                processed by us. In particular, you have the right to do the
                following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you
                have previously given your consent to the processing of your
                information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing
                of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal
                basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if
                information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure
                regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of
                the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right
                to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be
                updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain
                circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information,
                in which case, we will not process your information for any
                purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under
                certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal
                Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your
                information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable
                format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to
                another controller without any hindrance. This provision is
                applicable provided that your information is processed by
                automated means and that the processing is based on your
                consent, on a contract which you are part of or on
                pre-contractual obligations thereof.

              <h2>The right to object to processing</h2>
              <p>
                Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest,
                in the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the
                purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may
                object to such processing by providing a ground related to your
                particular situation to justify the objection. You must know
                that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for
                direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at
                any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether
                we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing
                purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this
                document.

              <p>
                In addition to the rights as explained in this Privacy Policy,
                California residents who provide Personal Information (as
                defined in the statute) to obtain products or services for
                personal, family, or household use are entitled to request and
                obtain from us, once a calendar year, information about the
                Personal Information we shared, if any, with other businesses
                for marketing uses. If applicable, this information would
                include the categories of Personal Information and the names and
                addresses of those businesses with which we shared such personal
                information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g.,
                requests made in the current year will receive information about
                the prior year). To obtain this information please contact us.
              </p>
              <h2>Billing and payments</h2>
              <p>
                In case of services requiring payment, we request credit card or
                other payment account information, which will be used solely for
                processing payments. Your purchase transaction data is stored
                only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase
                transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction
                information is deleted. All direct payment gateways adhere to
                the latest security standards as managed by the PCI Security
                Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa,
                MasterCard, American Express and Discover. Sensitive and private
                data exchange happens over a SSL secured communication channel
                and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures, and our
                Website is also in compliance with PCI vulnerability standards
                in order to create as secure of an environment as possible for
                Users. Scans for malware are performed on a regular basis for
                additional security and protection.

                please do not submit any Personal Information through our
                Website or Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to
                monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this
                Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal
                Information through our Website or Service without their
                permission.
              </p>

                If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13
                has provided Personal Information to us through our Website or
                Service, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years
                of age to consent to the processing of your Personal Information
                in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or

                information on how to contact the sender. You may choose to stop
                receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the
                unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or by
                contacting us. However, you will continue to receive essential

                websites you visit that you do not want to have your online
                activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or
                collecting information in connection with a website. For these
                purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable
                information from consumers who use or visit a website or online
                service as they move across different websites over time. Our
                Website does not track its visitors over time and across third
                party websites. However, some third party sites may keep track
                of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which
                enables them to tailor what they present to you.
